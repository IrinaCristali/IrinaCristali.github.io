<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. I am broadly interested in causal inference, random graphs, and differential privacy. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://http://victorveitch.com">Victor Veitch</a>.

<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Duke University, where I double majored in mathematics and statistical science. I had the pleasure to work with Professor <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/">Richard Durrett</a> on developing limit theorems for spatio-temporal stochastic processes, to study statistical learning theory with Professor <a href="https://sayanmuk.github.io">Sayan Mukherjee</a>, and to collaborate with Professor <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/a2layton">Anita Layton</a> on mathematically modelling renal physiology mechanisms.

Prior to Duke, I was born and raised in Bucharest, Romania, where I nurtured my passion for finding rigorous proofs and explanations, by participating in numerous math contests and olympiads.
