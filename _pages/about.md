<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago, currently working in collaboration with Professor <a href="https://http://victorveitch.com">Victor Veitch</a> on causal inference for network data. More broadly, I am interested in foundational problems in machine learning, specifically, developing a unified understanding of the interplay between causality, differential privacy, and the generalization and convergence properties of algorithms.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Duke University, where I double majored in mathematics and statistical science. I was extremely fortunate to work with Professor <a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/">Richard Durrett</a> on developing limit theorems for spatio-temporal stochastic processes, to study statistical learning theory with Professor <a href="https://sayanmuk.github.io">Sayan Mukherjee</a>, and to collaborate with Professor <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/a2layton">Anita Layton</a> on mathematically modelling renal physiology mechanisms.

Prior to Duke, I was born and raised in Bucharest, Romania, where I nurtured my passion for finding rigorous proofs and explanations, by participating in numerous math contests and olympiads.
